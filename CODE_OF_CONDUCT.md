# Code of Conduct

> Local chapters should fork this document and modify to meet the needs of their communities.

All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, contributors and volunteers are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

Papers We Love meet-ups are for anyone interested in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and its history to discuss academic research in a fun, engaging and respectful environment. 

**Be an adult, don't be a jerk.**

We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the meet-ups and at all Papers We Love events and interactions on the GitHub repository.

What it means
-------------

Papers We Love is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meet-up participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meet-up, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Papers We Love.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the meet-up at the sole discretion of the organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

Spelling it out
---------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Contributors to the GitHub repository and the Meetup site, sponsors, or similar are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Organizers (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
